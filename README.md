LED-Clock
=========

LED Clock based on Charlieplexed LEDs and WS2812B LED strip
One of my clocks stopped working – and it happened to be a clock my wife likes a lot. Went to the repair shop and the guy said that he didn’t have the spare parts and could not repair this. So – I thought – why not build an LED clock – I had tons of LEDs and an RTC module just waiting to be used.
